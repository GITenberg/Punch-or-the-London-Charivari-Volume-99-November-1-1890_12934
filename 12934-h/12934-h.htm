    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. XXI.&mdash;THE AVERAGE UNDERGRADUATE.</h3>

    <p>Those who live much in the society of the very middle-aged,
    hear from them loud and frequent complaints of the decay of
    courtesy and the general deterioration, both of manners and of
    habits, observable in the young men of the day. With many
    portentous shakings of the head, these grizzling censors inform
    those who care to listen to their wailings, that in the time of
    their own youth it was understood to be the duty of young men
    to be modest, considerate, generous in their treatment of one
    another, and chivalrous in their behaviour to women. And every
    one of them will probably suggest to his hearers that he was
    intimately acquainted with at least one young man who fulfilled
    that duty with a completeness and a perfection never since
    attained. Now, however, they will declare, the case is
    different. Young men have become selfish and arrogant. Their
    respect for age has vanished, their behaviour to ladies is
    familiar and flippant, their style of conversation is slangy
    and disreputable, they are wanting in all proper reverence,
    they are pampered, luxurious, affected, foolish, and
    disingenuous; unworthy, in short, to be mentioned in the same
    breath with those who have preceded them, and have left to
    their degenerate successors a brilliant but unavailing example
    of youthful conduct. These diatribes may or may not be founded
    to some extent in truth. At the best, however, their truth is
    only a half-truth. So long as the world endures, it is probable
    that young men will have a large allowance of follies, of
    affectations, of extravagances, and the young men of to-day are
    certainly not without them. But, in the main, though the task
    of comparison is difficult, they do not appear to be at all
    inferior in manliness, in modesty of bearing, and in reverence
    to the generations that have gone before. Here and there in
    London the antics of some youth plunged into a torrent of folly
    before he had had time even to think of being wise, excite the
    comments of the world. But London is not the school to which
    one would look for youth at its best. To find that in any
    considerable quantity one must travel either to Cambridge or to
    Oxford, and inspect the average undergraduates, who form the
    vast majority at both these Universities.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/205.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="The Average Undergraduate." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Now the Average Undergraduate, as he exists, and has for
    ages existed, is not, perhaps, a very wise young man. Nor does
    he possess those brilliant qualities which bring the Precocious
    Undergraduate to premature ruin. He has his follies, but4 they
    are not very foolish; he has his affectations, but they are
    innocent; he has his extravagances, but they pass away, and
    leave him not very much the worse for the experience. On the
    whole, however, he is a fine specimen of the young
    Englishman&mdash;brave, manly, loyal, and upright. He is the
    salt of his University, and an honour to the country that
    produces him.</p>

    <p>The Average Undergraduate will have been an average
    schoolboy, not afflicted with too great a love of classics or
    mathematics, and gifted, unfortunately, with a fine contempt
    for modern languages. But he will have taken an honourable part
    in all school-games, and will have acquired through them not
    only vigorous health and strength, but that tolerant and
    generous spirit of forbearance without which no manly game can
    be carried on. These qualities he will carry with him to the
    University which his father chooses for him, and to which he
    himself looks forward rather as a home of liberty slightly
    tempered by Proctors, than as a temple of learning, moderated
    by examiners.</p>

    <p>During the October term which makes him a freshman, the
    Average Undergraduate devotes a considerable time to mastering
    the etiquette of his University and College. He learns that it
    is not customary to shake hands with his friends more than
    twice in each term, once at the beginning, and again at the end
    of the term. If he is a Cambridge man, he will cut the tassel
    of his academical cap short; at Oxford he will leave it long;
    but at both he will discover that sugar-tongs are never used,
    and that the race of Dons exists merely to plague him and his
    fellows with lectures, to which he pays small attention, with
    enforced chapels, which he sometimes dares to cut, and, with
    general disciplinary regulations, to which he considers it
    advisable to submit, though he is never inclined to admit their
    necessity. He becomes a member of his college boat-club, and
    learns that one of the objects of a regular attendance at
    College Chapel is, to enable the freshman to practise keeping
    his back straight. Similarly, Latin Dictionaries and Greek
    Lexicons are, necessarily, bulky, since, otherwise, they would
    be useless as seats on which the budding oarsman may improve
    the length of his swing in the privacy of his own rooms. These
    rooms are all furnished on the same pattern. A table, a
    pedestal desk for writing, half-a-dozen ordinary chairs, a
    basket arm-chair, perhaps a sofa, some photographs of
    school-groups, family photographs in frames, a cup or two, won
    at the school athletic sports, a football cap, and a few prints
    of popular pictures, complete the furniture and decorations of
    the average College rooms. Of course there are, even amongst
    undergraduates, wealthy æsthetes, who furnish their rooms
    extravagantly&mdash;but the Average Undergraduate is not one of
    them.</p>

    <p>On the fifth of November the freshman sallies forth only to
    find, with a sense of bitter disappointment, that the rows
    between Town and Gown are things of the past. He will have
    discovered ere this that undergraduate etiquette has ordained
    that while he wears a cap and gown he must forswear gloves, and
    leave his umbrella at home, even though the rain should pour
    down in torrents. All these ordinances he observes strictly,
    though he can neither be "hauled" nor "gated" for setting them
    at defiance. Towards the end of his first term he begins to
    realise more accurately the joys and privileges of University
    life, he has formed his set, and more or less found his level,
    he has become a connoisseur of cheap wine, he has with pain and
    labour learned to smoke, he has certainly exceeded his
    allowance, and he returns to his home with the firm conviction
    that he knows a great deal of life. He will terrify his mother
    with tales of proctorial misadventures, and will excite the
    suspicions of his father by the new brilliance of his attire.
    Indeed it is a curious fact that whatever the special pursuit
    of the Average Undergraduate may be, and whatever may be the
    calling and profession of his father, the two are generally
    engaged in a financial war. This always ends in the triumph of
    the older man, who never scruples to use the power which the
    possession of the purse gives him in order to discomfit his
    son. From a University point of view, the average father has as
    little variety as the average son.</p>

    <p>It must be noted that away from the University or his family
    circle, and in the society of ladies, the Average Undergraduate
    is shy. The wit that flashed so brilliantly in the College
    Debating Club is extinguished, the stream of humour that flowed
    amidst shouts of laughter in the Essay Society is frozen at its
    source, the conversation that delighted the frequenters of his
    rooms is turned into an irresponsive mumble. But as soon as he
    returns to the academic groves, and knows that petticoats are
    absent, and that his own beloved "blazer" is on his back,
    Richard is himself again. He has his undergraduate heroes whom
    he worships blindly, hoping himself to be some day a hero and
    worthy of worship. Moreover, there are in every College
    traditions which cause the undergraduate who is a member of it
    to believe that the men of that particular society are finer
    fellows than the men of any other. These traditions the Average
    Undergraduate holds as though they were articles of his
    religion.</p>

    <p>The Average Undergraduate generally takes a respectable
    position as a College oarsman or cricketer, though he may fail
    to attain to the University Eight or to the Eleven. He passes
    his examinations with effort, but still he passes them. He
    recks not of Honours. The "poll" or the pass contents him.
    Sometimes he makes too much noise, occasionally he dines too
    well. In London, too, his conduct during vacations is perhaps a
    little exuberant, and he is often inclined to treat the
    promenades at the Leicester Square Variety Palaces as though he
    had purchased them. But, on the whole, he does but little harm
    to himself and others. He is truthful and ingenuous, and
    although he knows himself to be a man, he never tries to be a
    very old or a very wicked one. In a word, he is wholesome. In
    the end he takes his degree creditably enough. His years at the
    University have been years of pure delight to him, and he will
    always look back to them as the happiest of his life. He has
    not become very learned, but he will always be a useful member
    of the community, and whether as barrister, clergyman, country
    gentleman, or business man, he will show an example of manly
    uprightness which his countrymen could ill afford to lose.</p>

    <p>FINIS.&mdash;The last nights on earth at the Haymarket are
    announced of <i>A Village Priest</i>. May he rest in piece. The
    play that immediately follows is, <i>Called Back</i>; naturally
    enough a revival, as the title implies. But one thing is
    absolutely certain, and that is, that <i>A Village Priest</i>
    will never be <i>Called Back</i>. Perhaps <i>L'Abbé
    Constantin</i> may now have a chance. Eminently good, but not
    absolutely saintly. Is there any chance of the <i>Abbé</i>
    being "translated?"</p>

    <h2>SEEING THE STARS.</h2>

    <p>The following paragraph appears in the columns of the
    <i>Scottish Leader</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Those who were out of doors in Edinburgh at three
        o'clock on Saturday morning were startled by the appearance
        of a brilliant meteorite in the northern hemisphere. Its
        advent was announced by a flash of light which illuminated
        the whole city. A long fiery streak marked its course, and
        remained visible for more than a minute. At first this
        streak was perfectly straight, but, after it had begun to
        fade, it broke into a zig-zag."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The phenomenon so graphically described, though remarkable,
    is not, we believe, in the circumstances, entirely novel.
    Perhaps it is noteworthy as coming a little early in the year.
    We understand that on New Year's Day, "those who are out of
    doors in Edinburgh at three o'clock in the morning," are not
    unfrequently startled in somewhat similar manner.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>THE TOOTHERIES.&mdash;"TOOTH's Gallery" always strikes as a
    somewhat misleading appellation. It always appears to have more
    to do with palates than pictures, and to be more concerned with
    gums than gold frames. No doubt the head of the firm of Messrs.
    ARTHUR TOOTH AND SONS is a wise TOOTH, so let him christen his
    gallery the "Arthurnæum." He is a TOOTH that you can<i>not</i>
    stop, he is always coming out, and this autumn he comes out
    stronger than ever with a most interesting and varied
    collection. Excellent examples you may find of J.B. BURGESS,
    J.C. HOOK, BASTIEN LEPAGE, TADEMA, VICAT COLE, PETER GRAHAM,
    MILLAIS, LEADER, C. CALTHROP, MARCUS STONE, and other
    notables.</p>

    <h2>ROBERT AS HUMPIRE.</h2>

    <p>I was a takin of my favrit walk, larst Friday was a week,
    from Charing Cross round to my own privet residence in Queen
    street, when a yung lad tapped me on the sholder and said to
    me, "Please, Sir, are you the sillybrated Mr. ROBERT, the Citty
    Waiter?" In course I replied, "Yes, most suttenly;" when he
    said, "Then this yere letter's for you, and I wants a emediat
    arnser." Concealing my wisibel estonishment, I took him hup
    Healy Place, where the werry famous Lawyer lives, as can git
    you out of any amownt of trubbel, and then opened the letter,
    and read the following most estonishing words, wiz.:&mdash;"Mr.
    ROBERT,&mdash;can you come <i>immediately</i> to the
    &mdash;&mdash; Club, as you alone can decide a very heavy wager
    that is now pending between two Noble Lords who are here
    awaiting your arrival. You will be well paid for your trouble.
    The Bearer will show you the way.&mdash;J.N." I coud learn
    nothink from my jewwenile guide, so I told him to lead the way,
    and off we started, and soon arived at the Club.</p>

    <p>I need ardly say that, being all quite fust-rate swells,
    they receaved me in the most kindest manner, and ewen smiled
    upon me most freely, which in course I felt as a great
    complement.</p>

    <p>One on 'em then adrest me sumwot as follers, "I'm sure, Mr.
    ROBERT, we are all werry much obliged to you for coming so
    reddily at my request." At which they all cried, "Here! here!"
    "You of coarse understand what we wish you to do." To which I
    at once replide, "Quite so, my noble swells." At which they all
    larfed quite lowd, tho' I'm sure I don't kno why. He then said
    that it was thort better not to menshun the names of any of the
    Gents present, and he then presented me with a little packet,
    which he requested I woud not open till I got home, and then
    proseeded to xplain the Wager, somthink like this. Two of the
    noble Lords present, it apeared, had disagreed upon a certain
    matter, and, wanting a Humpire of caracter and xperience to
    decide between them, had both agreed to a surgestion that had
    bin made, that of all the many men in London none coudn't be
    considered more fitter for the post than Mr. ROBERT, the
    sillybrated Citty Waiter!</p>

    <p>I rayther thinks as I blusht wisibly, and I knos as I bust
    out into a perfuse prusperashun, but I didn't say a word, but
    pulled myself together as I can ginerally do when I feels as
    it's necessary to manetane my good charackter. He then said,
    "The question for you to deside is this: At a great and most
    himportant Dinner that is about to be held soon, at which most
    of the werry grandest swells left in Lundon will be present, we
    intends to hinterduce 'The Loving Cup;' not," he added,
    smiling, "so much to estonish the natives, as to stagger the
    strangers. The question, therefore, that you, as the leading
    Citty Waiter of the day, have to settle, is, How many of the
    Gests stand up while one on 'em drinks?" Delighted to find how
    heasy was my tarsk, I ansers, without a moment's hezzitation,
    "Three!" One on 'em turned garstly pale, and shouted out, "What
    for?" To which I replied, "One to take off and hold up the
    cover, the second to bow, and drink out of the Cup, and the
    third to protect the Drinker while he drinks, lest any ennemy
    should stab him in the back."</p>

    <p>The garstly pale Gent wanted to arsk more questions, but the
    rest shouted, "Horder! Horder!" and the fust Gent coming up to
    me again, thanked me for what he called my kindness in cumming,
    so I made 'em my very best bow, which I copied from a certain
    Poplar Prince, and took my departure.</p>

    <p>Being, I hopes, a man of strict werassity, I never wunce
    took ewen so much as a peep at the little packet as the Gent
    gave me, but I couldn't help feeling ewery now and then to see
    if it was quite safe, which of course it was, and ewen when I
    reached my umbel abode, I still restrained my natral
    curiossity, and sat down, and told my wundrus tail to the wife
    of my buzzom, and then placed the little packet in her
    estonished ands, which she hopened with a slite flutter, and
    then perdoosed from it <i>Five Golden Souverings!</i> If any
    other noble swells wants another Humpire on the same libberal
    terms, let 'em send to ROBERT.</p>

    <p>Christmas Books now make their appearance, and the first and

    favourite authors, G.A. HENTY, who this year gives them another
    exciting historical tale, <i>By England's Aid</i>, which deals
    with the closing events of the War of Independence in Holland.
    Also <i>Maori and Settler</i>, a story of the New Zealand War,
    when young England was quite a settler for the Maori. Both
    recommended. <i>Hal Hungerford</i>, by J.R. HUTCHINSON, is a
    good book for boys, and <i>A Rash Promise, or, Meg's Secret</i>
    by CECILIA SELBY LOWNDES, is an equally good one for girls, and
    finally <i>The Girls' Own Paper Annual</i>, and <i>The Boys'
    Own Paper Annual</i>, are two very handsome capitally
    illustrated gift-books." Now the Baron's cheerful assistants
    have done their work, he himself, has something to say.</p>

    <p>"No, my dear and venerable Mr. T. SIDNEY COOPER, R.A.," says
    the Baron to that eminent octogenarian Academician, whose
    "reminiscences" BENTLEY AND SON have just published; "if you
    are correctly quoted in the <i>P.M.G.</i>, your memory is
    absolutely at fault in describing DOUGLAS JERROLD as 'Editor of
    <i>Punch</i>.' He never was. Your account of the doings at the
    hebdomadal board of the <i>Punch</i> Staff College must be

    <p>Permit the Baron to strongly recommend MARION CRAWFORD's
    <i>A Cigarette-Maker's Romance</i>. Slight indeed is the plot,
    and few the <i>dramatis personæ</i>: but the latter are drawn
    with a Meissonier-like finish, and the simple tale is
    charmingly and touchingly told. The wonder of it is that so
    little to tell should have occupied two volumes; and a greater
    wonder remains, which is, that, at the close, the reader should
    wish there were a third. To create this desire is, after all,
    the very perfection of the art of novel-writing. The novelist
    who does not make the reader "wish as there was more on it,"
    according to the philosophic <i>dictum</i> of <i>Sam Weller</i>
    on the art of epistolary correspondence, has failed. Henceforth
    this novel of Mr. CRAWFORD's goes forth to the world with the
    Baron's best <i>imprimatur</i>. This poor little
    cigarette-maker requires no puffing of her wares. Enough that
    the Baron should say to his readers, "<i>Tolle lege!</i>" You
    will be delighted with it, "<i>Il cigaretto per esser
    felice</i>." It is a charming story, says emphatically,</p>

    <i>Valentina</i> in <i>Les Huguenots</i> is worth recording,
    even though it does not beat the record. It is said to be an
    uninteresting part, yet I remember everybody being uncommonly
    enthusiastic about this same <i>Valentina</i> when GRISI played
    it, and <i>her</i> "Valentine" was <i>Romeo</i>-like MARIO.
    Their struggle, his Leap for Life out of the window after the
    great "<i>Tu M'ami</i>" solo and duet, her despair, will never
    be forgotten. "Nothing in the part," quotha! Nothing in the
    person more likely. Signor PADILLA, excellent actor, is here
    again. Signor INGENIO CORSI has been "lent" by Sheriff AUGUSTUS
    DRURIOLANUS, and we hope he'll be returned safe, sound, and
    unspoilt, carefully packed, "G uppermost," in time for the
    Royal Italian Season. More nice names of good omen in the
    ballet, LOUISE LOVEDAY,&mdash;hope she'll "love-night" as well,
    and be always ready to dance,&mdash;and "JESSIE
    SMILES!"&mdash;does she! Bless her heart! Signor ARD 'ITTY, as
    'ARRY would say, is the energetic "Conductor," so that Signor
    LAGO's 'bus "full inside&mdash;all right!" ought to go along
    pleasantly, and do well.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.&mdash;Lucia di Lammermoor</i>, with Mlle.
    STROMFELD in the title <i>rôle</i>, singing well, and recalled
    several times by a fairly filled house. Signor SUANE, the
    <i>Edgardo</i>, looking better than he sang. But what a fine
    old crusted piece of Italianised conventionality the Opera is,
    with about as much to do with Scotland as it has with SCOTT!
    From the general demeanour and appearance of the Chorus of
    "Ladies and Knights," and "Friends of Lord ASHTON," the ASHTONS
    evidently in a very second-rate set at Lammermoor. However, it
    must be admitted that their attitude, as spectators of
    <i>Lucia's</i> delirium, left nothing to desire on the score of
    repose&mdash;the VERE DE VERES themselves could not have been
    calmer, or less concerned. Blue chins, and sympathy expressed
    by semaphore action, in the good old time-honoured fashion. The
    "Warriors of Ravenswood" in Lincoln green hunting costume, and
    the tombs of <i>Edgardo's</i> fathers under a marble
    colonnade&mdash;to give the necessary local colour.</p>

    <p>Good house on Saturday for <i>Robert the
    Devil</i>,&mdash;not <i>our</i> "ROBERT" the Waiter. But Signor
    LAGO must not be satisfied with things as they are.</p>

    <h2>TO ENGELBERG AND BACK.</h2>

    <h4><i>Being a few Notes taken en route in search of a Perfect
    Cure.</i></h4>

    <p>"Oh! he's ever so much better. Why he only had two stumbles,
    and one cropper, doing his three hundred yards this morning.
    That beats the record, anyhow."</p>

    <p>Young JERRYMAN is describing the effect the Engelberg air is
    already having on the Dilapidated One to several people, who
    have either been invalided themselves, or have had invalid
    relatives, or met, seen, or heard of invalids who have had
    similar satisfactory experiences.</p>

    <p>"You know, I think the dining has a great deal to do with
    the beneficent effects of the place," remarked, meekly, a
    mild-mannered Clergyman, who, had been brought up here
    apparently to "get tone." "You can't sit down to table with
    three hundred people," he continued, meditatively; as if the
    solution of the social problem had caused him some anxious
    thought, "without being inclined to launch out a little more
    than one does under ordinary conditions at home. Only I wish
    they wouldn't think it necessary to keep their dining-saloon at
    such an excessive temperature, and waste quite so much time
    between the different courses."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/213-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/213-1.png"
             alt="A Pleasant Little Excursion." /></a>A Pleasant
             Little Excursion.
    </div>

    <p>And here the mild-mannered Clergyman had real ground for
    complaint; for the German recipe for <i>table d'hôte</i> dinner
    seems to be something very much like the following:&mdash;Get a
    room that has been smoked in, with closed and tightly-fastened
    windows and doors, all the morning. Light the stove, if there
    is one, and turn on the gas, if there is any. You begin your
    dinner. Take twice, thrice, or, even four times of every
    course, glaring savagely and defiantly at your neighbour as you
    pass the dish. Sit over each, allowing a good quarter of an
    hour for its proper digestion, and keep this up till the
    perspiration drops from your face. Finally, in about two hours'
    time, having carefully mopped your forehead, quit the table for
    the "Conversations Saal." Here (still keeping in gas and stove,
    if there is one) smoke till you can't see six feet before you.
    Keep this up till you have had enough of it, and feel the time
    is getting on for you to go through a modified edition of the
    same process at supper. At least, this is how the German
    element&mdash;a very formidable one at the Hôtel
    Titlis&mdash;for the most part, conducted itself over the
    principal meal of the day. There were, of course, exceptions,
    for all Germany is not essentially German; yet it must be
    confessed that the prevailing features were of this guzzling,
    and, for the want of a more descriptive word, I would add,
    "sweltering" type, not fully appreciated by the ordinary
    travelling Briton, who, whatever else he may be, is not a gross
    feeder, though he does set the proper value on a breath of pure
    fresh air.</p>

    <p>"Get him up? Of course we can get him up," rejoined Dr.
    MELCHISIDEC, warmly. This in answer to some doubts expressed by
    one of the more cautions spirits of our party as to the
    possibility of dragging the Dilapidated One over one of the
    stock excursions of the neighbourhood, to wit, the Fürren Alp.
    "Why, put him into a <i>chaise à porteur</i>, and we could get
    him up the Titlis itself, and throw in the Schlossstock, and
    the Gross-Spannort, for the matter of that, as well.
    <i>Baedeker</i> makes only a two and a half hours' affair of
    it."</p>

    <p>And so we find ourselves in due course, doing the
    "Fürren-Alp" in approved style.</p>

    <p>"By Jove, I'll be hanged if I think it's a bit better than
    going up Primrose Hill, twenty times running: and not near such
    good going either," observes young JERRYMAN, after we have been
    struggling up a precipitous mountain path, occasionally finding
    ourselves sliding and slipping backwards in the bed of a
    disused watercourse, for about two hours and a half.</p>

    <p>And really I think young JERRYMAN's view of the matter is
    not so very far out, after all.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>ONE RITE, AND ALL WRONG.&mdash;The "Service of
    Reconciliation" in St. Paul's seems to have had the effect of
    setting everyone by the ears. Quite a muddle,&mdash;a Western
    Church, and an Easton rite.</p>

        <p>"A Correspondent of '<i>the Field</i>' records an
        experiment which he made with a wasp. 'Having,' he says,
        'severed a wasp in two pieces, I found that the head and
        thorax with the uninjured wings retained full vitality....
        It tried to fly, but evidently lacked the necessary balance
        through the loss of the abdomen. To test the matter
        further, I cut out an artificial tail from a piece of thin
        cardboard, as nearly following the shape of the natural
        body as possible. To fasten the appendage to the wasp, I
        used a little oxgall ...; gum or more sticky substances
        would not do, as it impedes the use of the wings in flight.
        Presently the operation was complete, and, to my surprise,
        the wasp, after one or two ineffectual efforts, flew in
        rather lopsided fashion to the window. It then buzzed about
        for at least a quarter of an hour, eventually flying out at
        the top ... it was vigorous when it flew
        away."&mdash;<i>Extract from an Evening Paper.</i></p>

    <h2>"GIVE IT TO THE BARD!"</h2>

    <p>Mr. ROBERT INGERSOLL speaking of, and at, Poet WALT WHITMAN
    on the occasion of presenting the aged and eccentric poet with
    the "long contemplated testimonial," to quote <i>The Times</i>,
    said, that "W.W. is intellectually hospitable"&mdash;this
    sounds like 'ready to take in anybody'&mdash;"but he refuses to
    accept a creed merely because it is wrinkled, old, and
    white-bearded. Hypocrisy wears a venerable look; and relies on
    its mask to hide its stupidity and fear." Now this was rather
    rough on the Bard, who is described as "an interesting figure,
    with his long white hair falling over his shoulders." It seemed
    as if ROBERT INGERSOLL wished to imply, Don't be taken in and
    accept W.W. at his own poetic valuation as a poet, simply
    because he is wrinkled, old, white-haired, and wears a
    venerable look, which, after all, may be only a hypocritical
    mask? Mr. INGERSOLL couldn't have been more infelicitous if he
    had "come to bury 'WHITMAN,' not to praise him." Then he went
    on, "Neither does WHITMAN accept everything new." This clearly
    excepted the testimonial, which, we may suppose, was brand new,
    or at all events, had been so at some time or other, though
    having been "long contemplated" it might have got a trifle
    dusty or mouldy. Then finished the orator, magnificently,
    epigrammatically, and emphatically, thus "He" (<i>i.e.</i>,
    WALT WHITMAN) "wants truth." And with all our heart and soul we
    reply, "We wish he may get it."</p>

    <h2>EMPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL.</h2>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;In the <i>St. James's Gazette</i> of Thursday
    week there was a quotation from Mr. BUCHANAN's <i>Modern
    Review</i>, where, in support of his opinions, he quotes
    "<i>Pope passim</i>." Whatever may be the outward and visible
    form of Mr. BUCHANAN's religion, it is discourteous, at least,
    even for an ultra-Presbyterian Scotchman, to spell the name of
    a Pope without making the initial letter a capital, and it is
    unlike a Scotchman not to make capital out of anything. Here, I
    may say, that Mr. BUCHANAN's contributions to recent
    journalistic literature have been mostly capital letters. But
    to return. Why POPE <i>passim</i>, and not POPE <i>Passim</i>,
    or POPE PASSIM? Is it not mis-spelt? In vain have I searched
    history for the name of this Pope. <i>Searchimus iterum</i>.
    But I must protest, in the mean time, of this particularly mean
    way of Bu-chananising a Roman Pontiff. Please accept this as a

    <p>A very odd thing. Just as we had got into Our Garden, were,
    so to speak, turning up our sleeves to hoe and dig, I have been
    called away. It is Mr. G. who has done it. The other day the
    Member for Sark and I were out weeding the walk&mdash;at least
    he was weeding, and I was remarking to him on the healthfulness
    of out-door occupation, more especially when pursued on the
    knees. Up comes the gardener with something on a pitchfork.
    Thought at first it was a new development of the polyanthus.
    (We are always growing strange things. The Member for Sark
    says, "In Our Garden it is the unexpected that happens.")
    Turned out to be a post-card. Our gardener is very careful to
    keep up our new character. If the missive had been brought to
    us in the house, of course it would have been served up on a
    plate. In the garden it is appropriately handed about on a
    pitch-fork.</p>

    <p>"My dear TOBY" (this is the post-card), "I'm just going up
    to Edinburgh; another Midlothian Campaign; You have been with
    me every time; don't desert me now; have something quite new
    and original to say on the Irish Question; would like you to
    hear it. Perhaps you never heard of Mitchelstown? Been looking
    up particulars. Mean to tell the whole story. Will be nice and
    fresh; come quite a shock on BALFOUR. Don't fail; Yours ever,
    W.E.G."</p>

    <p>Didn't fail, and here I am, not in Our Garden, but in
    Edinburgh. Left the Member for Sark in charge. A little uneasy;
    never know from day to day what his well-meant but ill-directed
    energy may not achieve. At least the celery will be safe. One
    day, after I had worn myself out with watching gardener dig
    trench, Sark came along, and in our absence filled it up. Said
    it looked untidy to have long hole like that in respectable
    garden. Supposed we had been laying a drain; quite surprised we
    weren't pleased, when he gleefully announced he had filled it
    up.</p>

    <p>Just come back from great meeting in Corn Exchange.
    Difficult to realise that it's eleven years since Mr. G. here
    in first campaign. A great deal happened in meantime, but
    enthusiasm just the same. Mr. G. I suppose a trifle older, but
    ROSEBERY still boyish-looking. Proceedings opened with
    procession of Delegates presenting addresses to Mr. G.
    Excellently arranged; reflects great credit on PAT CAMPBELL.
    (Capital name that for manager of variety <i>troupe</i>.)
    Leading idea was to present imposing representation of Liberal
    Scotia doing homage to its great chief. PAT caught on at once.
    Engaged thirty stalwart men: none of your seedy sandwich-board
    fellows; responsible-looking burghers of all ages and sizes.
    Got them together in room at left door of stage&mdash;I mean of
    platform; free breakfast; oatmeal cake; unstinted heather-honey
    and haddocks. Mr. G. seated in chair in very middle of stage,
    the place, you know, where great tragedians insist upon dying.
    Prompter's bell rings; Delegates file in, every man with what
    looks like a red truncheon in right hand; advance slowly along
    front of stage till reach chair where Mr. G. sits, apparently
    buried in deep thought.</p>

    <p>"What ho!" he cries, looking up with a start.</p>

    <p>"My liege," says the sandwich-board man&mdash;I mean the
    Delegate, "I bring hither the address of the Possilpark,
    Lambhill, Dykehead, Camburnathen, Wishaw, Dalbeattie, Catrine,
    and Sorn Liberal and Radical Association. Will I read it?"</p>

    <p>"I think not," said ROSEBERY, quietly, but firmly, and the
    Delegate, handing the red thing to Mr. G., passed on.</p>

    <p>Mr. G. smiling and bowing; audience applauded; next man
    comes. <i>He's</i> from the Duntocher, Faifley, Slamannan,
    Cockpen, Pennicuik, Clackmannan, Carnoustie, Kirkintilloch, and
    Lenzie Junior Liberal Association. He also wants to read the
    Address, but is mercifully hustled off, and the line, ever
    emerging from L. of stage, crosses, and passes on. At other
    side, PAT CAMPBELL waiting; a little anxious lest anything
    should go wrong to spoil his carefully-devised plan. But
    everything went well.</p>

    <p>"Get ye away now," PAT whispered in ear of the man from
    Possilpark, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Possilpark, &amp;c., at the clue, darted round rear of
    stage; got round in good time to L.; fell into line, and was
    ready to come on again. Same with the rest. Immense success! At
    the end of first three-quarters of an hour, PAT CAMPBELL
    arranged a block; pressure of innumerable Delegates so great,
    doncha, couldn't move off the stage in time. This gave
    opportunity for two of the stoutest burghers to go through
    quick change; reappeared, dressed in kilts. This fairly fetched
    down house.</p>

    <p>"The interminable procession," as ROSEBERY slyly called it,
    might have gone on till now, so perfect were the arrangements.
    But there was some talk of Mr. G. making a speech, and, at end
    of hour and fifty minutes the last Delegate slowly crossed in
    front of delighted audience, handed his red <i>bâton</i> to Mr.
    G., who, though he had entered thoroughly into the fun of the
    thing, was beginning to look a little fagged, and the speaking
    began.</p>

    <p>This was excellent, especially ROSEBERY's introduction of
    the travelling Star; a model of terse, felicitous language.
    Only one hitch here. Speaking of Mr. G.'s honoured age, he
    likened him to famous Doge of Venice, "old DANDOLO." ROSEBERY
    very popular in Edinburgh. But audience didn't like this;
    something like groan of horror ran along crowded benches.</p>

    <p>"Nae, nae," said one old gentleman, momentarily taking his
    knees out of the small of my back, "that winna do. 'Auld
    WULLIE' is weel enoo, but to ca' a man Auld DANDOLO to his face
    gars me greet." (Often met with this phrase in songs and Scotch
    novels: curious to see how it was done; fancy, from what
    followed, it's Scotch for taking snuff.)</p>

    <p>Barring this slip, everything went well. GLADSTONE
    delightful. So fresh, so informing, and so instructive! Began
    with lucid account of Battle of Waterloo; lightly sketched the
    state of parties at the period of the Reform agitation in 1832;
    glanced in passing at the regrettable conflict between the
    Northern and Southern States of America ("sons of one mother"
    as he pathetically put it); and so glided easily and naturally
    into a detailed account of the <i>mêlée</i> at Mitchelstown,
    which, as he incidentally mentioned, took place four years and
    a half ago.</p>

    <p>Audience sat entranced. You might have heard a pin drop, if
    indeed you wanted to. I wish the Member for Sark had been here

    in that hopeless pursuit to which he has given himself up, the
    growing of the peelless potato. He'll never do it.</p>

    <p>CORNWALL IN BAKER STREET.&mdash;The worst of Cornwall is, it
    is so far off&mdash;indeed, it has hitherto been quite out of
    sight. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. We
    waited, and Mr. JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD brought Niagara to
    Westminster. We waited again, and Mr. ARTHUR VOKINS brings
    Cornwall to Baker Street, and introduces us to a very clever
    young sea-scapist, Mr. A. WARNE-BROWNE&mdash;altogether a
    misnomer, for he isn't a worn brown at all, he is as fresh and
    bright and sharp as a newly-minted sovereign. Go and look at
    his "<i>Lizard and Stags</i>"&mdash;he isn't an animal-painter,
    though the title looks like it&mdash;his "<i>Breaking
    Weather</i>," his "<i>Rain Veils</i>," his "<i>Innis Head</i>,"
    or any one of his thirty pictures, and say if you don't agree
    with <i>Mr. Punch</i>. The whole of them are so true to Nature,
    are so faithful in their wave-drawing, there is such a
    breeziness, such a saltness pervades them throughout, and they
    so accurately convey the character of the Cornish coast, that
    <i>Mr. P.</i> felt quite the Cornishman, and is unable to
    decide whether he is the Tre Punch or the Pol Punch. On mature
    deliberation, he concludes he is the Pen Punch. There's no
    doubt about <i>that</i>!</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
